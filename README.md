# 📊 My Data Analytics Projects in Excel

Hi, and welcome to my collection of **data analytics projects built entirely in Microsoft Excel**.  
I created this repository to show how much can be achieved with Excel alone — from cleaning and transforming raw data to building dashboards and generating insights that could guide real-world decision-making.  

These projects are not just exercises — they reflect my interest in solving problems across industries, and they highlight my ability to make data useful, clear, and actionable.

## 💡 Why I Chose Excel
Yes, I know — Python, R, and Power BI are powerful. But Excel is still everywhere in business, and I want to show how far I could push myself and the application in my learning journey.  

For me, I observed that Excel is more than a spreadsheet — it’s a full analytics solution for newbies (The projects I downloaded and worked proved this!!). In this journey, I noticed with the right approach and attitude,I can:  
- Clean and reshape messy data  
- Build dashboards that decision-makers can use instantly  
- Tell a story with data without leaving Excel

## 📌 Notes
- All data is **public, anonymized, or simulated**.  
- I add new projects regularly as I learn new techniques or explore different industries.
